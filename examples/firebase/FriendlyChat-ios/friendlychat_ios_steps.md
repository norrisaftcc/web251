add the GoogleServices-info.plist to project supporting files

install cocoapods for dependency management: 
sudo gem install cocoapods

this includes a podfile, making one would use these steps: https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup

close xcode then run 
pod install

now use xcworkspace (which pod configed) rather than the xcproject
