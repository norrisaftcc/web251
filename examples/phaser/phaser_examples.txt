# phaser notes

Most of these tutorials come from Pablo Navarra (Zenva Academy and GameDev Academy).

Final Project Concepts

Any of these concepts could be extended into a final project.

To meet the web services requirement of the final project, you can incorporate your game with features such as online leaderboards, social elements, or even IAP (in-app purchases.) This can be done using publicly available libraries for Android and iOS. We will delve into this topic later on.



Starting Points and Basic Phaser Features

The two attached files BasicPhaser-Starter.zip and BasicPhaser-FarmAnimals.zip provide step-by-step examples of simple Phaser projects and are a good starting point to help you understand the Phaser library.
BasicPhaser-Startup starts with some simple JavaScript code to create a few objects and gradually adds in basic Phaser functionality to build a 'cross-the-road' type game where the player moves left and right to dodge obstacles. It's worth examining as it makes it easy to find individual steps without the logic of a more complex game.
BasicPhaser-FarmAnimals is modeled after a toddler's tablet game where you can click on farm animals to hear them make noises. Despite being simple, it includes a lot of elements such as animations, tweening (changing a sprite over time), and playing sounds.
Between those two and the phaser.io examples, most of the simple features you may want to use are included.


Simple Platformer (Donkey Kong clone):

From the Crater.io webconference - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQPvLuXpaMk&t=435s

GitHub with starting project and assets: https://github.com/fariazz/phaser-craterconf2016 

The attached Platformer.zip file includes the completed project.

The file PlatformerComplex.zip takes this in a different direction, more of a Super Mario Bros. type of game.





Top Down Shooter (Asteroids clone) - https://gamedevacademy.org/html5-phaser-tutorial-spacehipster-a-space-exploration-game/

Videos and GitHub tutorial are included in the article.

The attached SpaceShooter.zip continues this project, using touch controls.



Top Down Adventure Game

This sets up a simple tile-based top-down game (like the original Legend of Zelda).
